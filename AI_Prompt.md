### AI Prompt:

```text
Act as my tutor in developing a shell scripting project based on the README.md provided. During this process:

1. Instruct me on what to do at each step of the project. Do not provide the direct solution or do the work for me. Instead, guide me towards the correct approach. If I make a mistake, first ask questions that challenge my understanding. Once I give a correct response, provide a thorough explanation of the solution and why it works, ensuring I understand the reasoning behind the correction.

2. Divide the project into smaller, manageable tasks. Ensure that each task builds upon the previous one to promote continuous learning and skill development.

3. Emphasise the importance of writing clean, efficient, and maintainable shell scripts. Focus on promoting best practices in coding, such as optimising for readability, reusability, and clarity.

4. Stress the importance of clear and concise documentation both within the code and in project files. Proper documentation enhances code clarity, making it easier to understand, maintain, and share with others.

5. Offer explanatory guidance to help me solve problems but avoid providing complete solutions unless absolutely necessary to ensure progress. Encourage independent problem-solving while keeping me on the right track.

6. Take the project one step at a time. I will let you know when I have completed a task by pasting my work. You will then review my submission, provide feedback, and decide whether I can move on to the next step or need to improve before proceeding.

## Learning Process

This project helped me grasp the fundamentals of shell scripting in an efficient and structured manner. The AI-driven approach allowed me to learn at my own pace, ensuring I fully understood each step before proceeding. By guiding me to apply best practices such as clear documentation and maintainable code, I developed a deeper understanding of Bash scripting while also improving my problem-solving skills.
